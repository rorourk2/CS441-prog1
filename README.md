This app presents the user with 6 buttons(five at the top of the screen and one at the bottom). The upper five buttons each make one of the five letters of HELLO visible or invisible in the color of the button.
The bottom button changes the color of each letter to be the complementary color of their respective button.

After figuring out the basics of android studio, I had originally wanted to create an app with only one button that generates another button. The new button generating another button and then another button, etc. These buttons would eventually be positioned in a way to spell out HELLO. 
Unfortunately I couldn't quite figure out how to do this so I settled on having the buttons just show letters.
